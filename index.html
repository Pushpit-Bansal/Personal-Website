        Hi, my name is Pushpit bansal and i am the king of the valley and i have been typing this exact same sentence
        since 14yrs. i dont have job and gf and i dont have money also, all i have is u. i study in <a
            href="https://banyantree.in/chandigarh/#">Banyan tree school chandigarh </a>. that school has a hole in the
        door of the washroom and pee spread all over. we dont have soap and mirror in the washroom as well. Our <a
            href="https://banyantree.in/chandigarh/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/principle.jpeg">principal</a> is mad and
        claps like old people also. she sold the nets of cricket and earned 150rs. and with that money she oredered
        samsosa in school. Ok now let me tell u something about myself, i am the most handsome fella in my school, in my
        city and in my country as well. my name is pushpit but people call me poppy. I top every exam but i am a
        backbencher too, not really. i like to do <a
            href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.trex-game.skipser.com%2F&psig=AOvVaw1ymoJoDzEevs3s7LBZBqYa&ust=1670224403217000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CBAQjRxqFwoTCKjKvLe03_sCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD">shit</a>
        on computers and i like to argue with teachers. my nickname at home is gugu. if u are wondering how to pronounce
        it just say <a href="https://translate.google.com/?sl=auto&tl=hi&text=goo&op=translate&hl=en">gooüí©</a> 2 times.
        i dont have freinds tabhi i am writing this para. my friends stalk teachers on <a
            href="https://www.instagram.com">insta</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com">facebook</a>. i like to
        play cricket also. i wear an underwear on my head like a helmet so that my hair stay <a
            href="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b12c32ff8d6f26369108c40e7140ae267792da90/0_1629_4072_2443/master/4072.jpg?width=1200&height=1200&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&s=ea0b865143ef3d31952acdcb860d69a7">clean
            and sexy</a> and when i hit a century main apna kacha utar deta hun. at this point i have pain in my wrist,
        i have not done my hw since a week and i got a note in my diary as well regarding the same. but luckily i know
        how to do sign of my papa, so i'ma just do that by myself. i want to go the theatre and watch <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhediya_(film)">Bhediya</a>, it released today and there was one scene
        in which a snake comes out of bhaskar's underwear in the trailer. does everything transform when u become a
        wolf, i wonder! our school teaches girls self defense thinking they are weak but fun fact girls in our school
        are <a href="https://banyantree.in/chandigarh/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/principle.jpeg">80kg</a>, they dont
        need to learn self defense, they just need to fall on the guy and he goes into the ground and then he ded,
        whereas i am uh 39 kg. my mother instead of giving me curd to eat applies it on my hair. she makes tinde, touri,
        loki very bad, she makes maggi and bread butter the best. ok now i will end this paragraph with a <a
            href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EcW2ck8U0AEMluZ.jpg">pledge</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        india is my country and all indians are my brothers and sisers. i love my country and i am proud of its rich and
        varid heritage and i shall always strive to be worthy of it. i shall always give respect to my parents, teachers
        and all elders and treat everyone with curtesy. to my country and my people, i do not pledge my devotion. in
        their well being and prosperity alone lies my happiness
